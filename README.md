# Push To Tweet
This is my first Raspberry Pi Project that posts a tweet on your Twitter timeline by pressing a button. 

# Things you need
1. Twitter Developer Account
2. Raspberry Pi
3. Switch Button
4. Breadboad & Wires

# Steps
1. Create an App through your Twitter Developer Account & note down the *consumer_key, consumer_secret,access_token & access_secret* **Please ensure that the app has Read & Write Access and you generate these tokens after changing the access type**
2. Copy these keys into **auth.py** file
3. Setup the breadboard with the switch
4. Use this code and you're good to go :)
